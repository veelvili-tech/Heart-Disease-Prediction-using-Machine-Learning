# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

Developed a predictive model for heart disease using Python and machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, SVM, and XGBoost. Followed the CRISP-DM methodology for structured data analysis, including data understanding, preparation, modeling, and evaluation. Models were assessed using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to identify the most effective predictor of heart disease.
